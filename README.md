# mlx_lab: Minilibx laboratory

## Install minilibx on linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alterGNU/mlx_lab.git && cd mlx_lab && ./install_mlx.sh
```
- STEPS:
    - step 0: Exec the script as sudo
    - step 1: Check and install this script's dependancies (yes command).
    - step 2: Update and Upgrade the system (good practice before any installation).
    - step 3: Check and install mlx's dependancies (MLX_DEPS var. , check minilibx README to update list).
    - step 4: Clone and Make minilibx (MLX_PATH var. can be change to modify path and mlx folder's name).
    - step 5: Create a env_file, sourcing this file will add mlx's doc to man cmd (using MANPATH env-var).

- Two files are generated by this script:
    - env_file --> contain the new MANPATH value (need to be sourced).
    - <script_parent_dir>/<date><time>.log --> all this installation details log are redirected in this file.
