# mlx_lab: Minilibx laboratory

## `install_mlx.sh`: Install minilibx on linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alterGNU/mlx_lab.git && cd mlx_lab && ./install_mlx.sh
```
- Main steps:
  - step 0: Exec the script as sudo
  - step 1: Check and install this script's dependancies (cmds:date, git, perl, sed, yes).
  - step 2: Update and Upgrade the system (skippable step, but good practice before any installation).
  - step 3: Check and install mlx's dependancies (MLX_DEPS var. , check minilibx README to update list).
  - step 4: Clone and Make minilibx (MLX_PATH var. can be change to modify path and mlx folder's name).
  - step 5: Create a env_file, sourcing this file will add mlx's doc to man cmd (using MANPATH env-var).

- Two files are generated by this script:
  - env_file --> contain the new MANPATH value (need to be manually sourced).
  - <script_parent_dir>/<date><time>.log --> each exec. generates a log file that contains all cmds output.
